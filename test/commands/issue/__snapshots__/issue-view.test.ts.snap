"# TEST-123: Fix authentication bug in login flow

Users are experiencing issues logging in when their session expires. This affects the main authentication flow and needs to be resolved quickly.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Log in to the application
2. Wait for session to expire
3. Try to perform an authenticated action
4. Observe the error

## Expected behavior
User should be redirected to login page with clear messaging.

## Actual behavior
User sees cryptic error message and gets stuck.

## Comments

- **@Bob Senior** - *1/15/2024*

  Should we also consider implementing automatic session refresh?

- **@John Doe** - *1/15/2024*

  I've reproduced this issue on staging. The session timeout seems to be too aggressive.

  - **@Jane Smith** - *1/15/2024*

    Working on a fix. Will increase the session timeout and add proper error handling.

  - **@Alice Developer** - *1/15/2024*

    Sounds good! Also, we should add better error messaging for expired sessions.
