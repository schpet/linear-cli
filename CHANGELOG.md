### added

- adds a -t, --title flag to the `issue pr` command, allowing you to provide a
  PR title that is different than linear's issue title
- allows linear issue identifiers to be passed in as arguments to the issue
  commands as an alternative to parsing the branch name, e.g.
  `linear issue show ABC-123`
