this cli needs three things to work:

   [https://linear.app/settings/api](https://linear.app/settings/api)
2. your current git branch to start with a linear issue id, e.g.
   `eng-123-my-feature`
3. the directory of your repo to start with a linear team id, e.g.
   `eng-my-project`

## commands

### issue commands

the current issue is determined by the issue id in the current git branch name.
note that
[linear's github integration](https://linear.app/docs/github#branch-format) will
suggest these branch names.

```bash
linear issue           # opens current branch's issue in Linear.app
linear issue open      # same as above
linear issue print     # prints issue title and description (with markdown formatting)
linear issue id        # prints the issue id from current branch (e.g., "ENG-123")
linear issue title     # prints just the issue title
linear issue url       # prints the Linear.app URL for the issue
linear issue pr        # creates a GitHub PR with issue details via `gh pr create`
```

### team commands

name your repo directories with your project's linear team prefix for these to
work. i.e. if your linear team prefix is 'ENG'
`mv ~/code/cool-project ~/code/eng-cool-project`

```bash
linear team             # opens team page in Linear.app
linear team open        # same as above
linear team id          # prints the team id (e.g., "ENG")
linear team autolinks   # configures GitHub repository autolinks for Linear issues
```

### other commands

```bash
linear --help          # show all commands
linear --version       # show version
linear completions     # generate shell completions
```
