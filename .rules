## basics

- this is a deno app
- after editing any graphql documents, run `deno task codegen` to get the
  updated types after it's updated,
  `const result = await client.request(query, { teamId });` should work and be
  typed (and not require explicit types)
- graphql/schema.graphql has the graphql schema document for linear's api
